    "There are two options for setting up a simulation engine in the *mlip* library: ASE and Jax-MD. While ASE may be more familiar to most users, we recommend Jax-MD for performance as it allows running the entire simulation on GPU. As such we have written below the code for setting up a JaxMD simulation config, but have left commented out the script for ASE.\n",

    "- The approach used in JaxMD is to set a number of *episodes* in between which the code checks whether the functions need to be recompiled.\n",

    "MLIP models thrive at approaching DFT accuracy in simulations orders of magnitude faster than DFT. Due to the fact that they are machine learned functions, different MLIP models will have different speed / accuracy trade-offs. Therefore when chosing a model, users should be mindful of their objectives: smaller models will be faster, but oftentimes less accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another key considerations with MLIP models is that they can be specialised. The issue of course being that models trained to be specialised may have worse performance on general tasks. Related to this point: MLIP models are trained on a subset of the periodic table and therefore can only be run on systems that have the atomic species included in the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a simplistic illustration of using the wrong MLIP model the following example uses the MLIP model trained on aspirin to run a simulation on 3BPA - which has the same atomic species, but different structures. We can see that the model trained on aspirin only is not able to run a suitable simulation on 3BPA."
